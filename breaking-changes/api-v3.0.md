# â¬† API v3.0

Here is a list of breaking changes that happened during the API v3.0 period when differing versions of Terminaux introduced breaking changes.

## From 2.7.x to 3.0.x

Between the 2.7.x and 3.0.x version range, we've made the following breaking changes:

### Console extension separation

{% code title="ConsoleExtensions.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class ConsoleExtensions
```
{% endcode %}

The console extensions class needed to be separated to several classes to categorize the functions according to their type. This allows easier organization and distinguishing from the common Terminaux console functions from their extensions.

As a result, we've introduced several extensions that you can see here:

{% content-ref url="../usage/console-tools/console-extensions.md" %}
[console-extensions.md](../usage/console-tools/console-extensions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Consult the above page for functions and their categories to migrate from `ConsoleExtensions`.
{% endhint %}

### Brightness and contrast moved to `Transformation.Contrast`

{% code title="Affected classes" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
namespace Terminaux.Colors
```
{% endcode %}

We've moved all the brightness and the contrast classes and enumerations to the `Transformation` namespace. This is to ensure better organzation. The following classes are affected:

* `ColorBrightness`
* `ColorContrast`
* `ColorContrastType`

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll have to update your using clauses to `Terminaux.Colors.Transformation.Contrast` when calling any of these classes.
{% endhint %}

### Moved plain writing functions to `TextWriterRaw`

{% code title="TextWriterColor.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static void Write()
public static void WritePlain(string Text, params object[] vars)
public static void WritePlain(string Text, bool Line, params object[] vars)
public static void WritePlain(string Text, TermReaderSettings settings, params object[] vars)
public static void WritePlain(string Text, TermReaderSettings settings, bool Line, params object[] vars)
```
{% endcode %}

We've made a breaking change that moves all the raw writing to its own class to reduce confusion. The standard console writer, `TextWriterColor`, sets the colors regardless of the mode, while the plain writers are more focused on writing console sequences and other raw things to the terminal.

{% hint style="info" %}
Their names have not been changed, but they have been moved to `TextWriterRaw`, so you'll need to update the references to these functions to point to that class instead of the `TextWriterColor` class.
{% endhint %}

### Migrated input functions to `TermReader`

{% code title="Input.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static TermReaderSettings GlobalReaderSettings
public static string CurrentMask
public static string ReadLine(bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, string DefaultValue, TermReaderSettings settings, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineWrapped(bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineWrapped(string InputText, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineWrapped(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineWrapped(string InputText, string DefaultValue, TermReaderSettings settings, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool OneLineWrap = false, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLine(string InputText, string DefaultValue, bool OneLineWrap = false, TermReaderSettings settings = null, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineNoInput(bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineNoInput(TermReaderSettings settings, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineNoInput(char MaskChar, bool interruptible = true)
public static string ReadLineNoInput(char MaskChar, TermReaderSettings settings, bool interruptible = true)
```
{% endcode %}

We've discovered that all the `ReadLine()` functions and their associated properties and function overloads were duplicates of the TermReader's `Read()` function, so we've decided to migrate them to the `TermReader` class to avoid inconsistencies for both the application developer and the future versions of Terminaux.

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll have to refer to the `Read()` functions found in the `TermReader` class. You may have to change how to call the function by changing the signatures.
{% endhint %}

### Removed `ConsolePlatform`

{% code title="ConsolePlatform.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static class ConsolePlatform
```
{% endcode %}

All of its functions have been moved to SpecProbe's Software, so this entire class has been removed.

{% hint style="info" %}
As Terminaux already makes use of SpecProbe's Software, you should only change the reference to `ConsolePlatform` to point to `PlatformHelper`.
{% endhint %}

### Moved RGB value conversion tools

{% code title="ColorTools.cs" lineNumbers="true" %}
```csharp
public static double SRGBToLinearRGB(int colorNum)
public static int LinearRGBTosRGB(double linear)
```
{% endcode %}

The sRGB and the linear RGB conversion tools have been moved to the transformation tools as they were used for color transformation. They used to be in the `ColorTools` class, but they were used for color transformation formulas, such as color blindness simulation.

{% hint style="info" %}
These functions are not affected. You just have to update your references to `ColorTools` for these functions to point to `TransformationTools`.
{% endhint %}
