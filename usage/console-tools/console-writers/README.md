# Console Writers

Terminaux provides a vast amount of console writers for different purposes, like the progress bar writer, writing console output in color, etc. Also, you can use their `Render()` functions found in basically every static writer (not those that are dynamic, such as wrapped writers).

{% hint style="info" %}
The `Render()` functions are made primarily for plain writing operations. You can use them with `TextWriterRaw` writers.
{% endhint %}
