# ðŸ–Š Figlet Font Selector

The figlet font selector allows you to flexibly select a Figlet font provided by the external Figgle library not maintained by us. It shows you a live preview of the font to show you how your selected font looks like prior to submission.

You can simply invoke the selector on your interactive console application by calling the below function like so:

```csharp
string font = FigletSelector.PromptForFiglet();
```

Usually, this call is followed by getting a figlet font from the above variable and writing it using the `WriteFiglet()` function:

```csharp
var figlet = FigletTools.GetFigletFont(font);
FigletColor.WriteFiglet("Hello!", figlet, ConsoleColors.Green);
```
