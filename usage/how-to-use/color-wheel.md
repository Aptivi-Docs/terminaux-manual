# ðŸŽ¨ Color Wheel

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is available on 1.0.0 or higher.
{% endhint %}

This feature of Terminaux allows you to select a color from the color code (16 and 255 colors) or from the RGB levels (true color). It also allows you to get information about any color, similar to the color wheel function found in various web applications, including the built-in color blindness simulator located right in front of you.

For controls, the following keys do:

| Key                  | Action                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ESC`                | Exits the color selection                        |
| `ENTER`              | Accepts the color selection                      |
| `LEFT ARROW`         | Goes to the previous RGB level                   |
| `RIGHT ARROW`        | Goes to the next RGB level                       |
| `CTRL + LEFT ARROW`  | Decreases the color-blind severity               |
| `CTRL + RIGHT ARROW` | Increases the color-blind severity               |
| `TAB`                | Changes the color mode (16, 255, true)           |
| `UP ARROW`           | Increases the current RGB value of color         |
| `DOWN ARROW`         | Decreases the current RGB value of color         |
| `I`                  | Gives you more information about the colors used |

{% hint style="info" %}
By default, it starts in 16-color mode. If you want to use more than 16 colors, be sure to have a compatible console before trying to use the higher color spectrum.
{% endhint %}

When you invoke the color wheel from your application using one of the two overloads for the `InputForColor()` function, you'll most likely need to get its value, so you need to assign a color variable to the value of this function like so:

```csharp
var myColor = ColorWheel.InputForColor();
```

This is assuming that you've already imported the necessary namespace at the beginning of the C# code:

```csharp
using Terminaux.Colors.Wheel;
```

This function returns a `Color` instance containing necessary information. To know more about the structure of the `Color` class, visit the page below to learn more.
