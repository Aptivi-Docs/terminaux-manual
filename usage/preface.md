# ðŸ’¡ Preface

To use this library, you first need to know exactly why do you need to install Terminaux into your console application. If your application is intended to be an interactive one, or if your application shows graphics (text, info box, ...), then Terminaux is the right library for you.

Terminaux provides several terminal actions, like reading an input (was on TermRead), getting color information (was on ColorSeq), and using VT sequences and filtering them (was on VT.NET).

### Reading an input

To get started reading input, follow the below page to get started:

{% content-ref url="input-reader/" %}
[input-reader](input-reader/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Other console tools

For other console tools that Terminaux provides, you can access the below page:

{% content-ref url="console-tools/" %}
[console-tools](console-tools/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
